# OSC OSCar firmware

The OSCar firmware exists only in binary form. This repository is for keeping the disassembled binary and annotating it with comments, to analyze how it works. 

Should anyone find bugs in the software, they could also be recorded as issues here, to keep track of them.

In the binaries directory there are three known versions for safekeeping. We are really only interested in the OM2.bin, which is the latest available.

The source directory keeps the disassembled text file.
